# DSA Roadmap Checklist

This checklist to track my progress through important Data Structures and Algorithms topics.
Each header, is a data structure, or type of algorithm, or just a big problem type/domain. Each sub pointers under these headers, are important patterns that are useful to know under these broad categories.
